// Qt6 compatibility stubs implementation
// These classes were removed from Qt6 - providing minimal stubs for compilation

#include "QWinTaskbarStubs.h"

// The implementations are all inline in the header, but we need this
// file to exist so that MOC can generate the meta-object code for the Q_OBJECT macros

// MOC will generate the necessary meta-object implementations when this file is compiled
